    <h1>Modular bookshelf</h1>
    <p>
        Companies prefer Open plan office for an increase in communication, 
        while those working in the office want their privacy protected. 
        This bookcase can be used in different ways as needed. (When necessary, hang the board on the shelf.)
        The board blocks many peopleâ€™s eyes, and at the same time, it can be used to make ideas and give a simple meeting.

    <h1>Yeoun</h1>

        This project is started with improving the quality of life for a one-person household.
        After surveying them, we found that many people feel lonely but do not want to talk to others for a variety of reasons*.
        So we devised a new way of communication. The target of the service is the 20s and their parents. 
        We help them to communicate comfortably and by encouraging each other.

          I believe that digital humanity engineers should have the following expertise:<br> 
          1) design and develop products or services based on the data, 
          2) collect the user experience data, and 
          3) continuously improve the products or services using the collected data.
