        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Medly is an platform designed to support both physicians and patients throughout the pre-surgery process. It provides structured assistance by recording and summarizing consent forms for patients while helping them understand medical terminology. For physicians, it offers a chatbot that enables efficient searching of essential pre-surgery information, including medical research papers and various surgical guidelines.

      <h2>Problems Solving</h2> 

      <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
        <p>Processing data from multiple sources with different PDF formats (ranging from 50 to 280 pages) and refining it for chatbot integration. Understanding and organizing all the content manually is impractical, necessitating a structured format that computers can interpret.</p>
        <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> Text was extracted from PDFs and vectorized through embedding, enabling the system to process language autonomously. Additionally, chunk sizes were optimized (1000 characters with 100-character overlap) to maintain context while ensuring the summarization was not overly condensed, improving chatbot performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 2</h3>
        <p>Ensuring the reliability of medical chatbot responses while preventing hallucinations, and optimizing reference section readability for busy physicians.</p>
        <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> The system displays reference areas with original data sources, allowing physicians to verify AI-generated responses. The RAG model is configured with higher strictness and a lower temperature setting to ensure that it does not generate information beyond the dataset, minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, chunking methods were implemented to shorten displayed reference text, and preprocessing pipelines were set up to remove unnecessary repeating headers and irrelevant extracted characters, ensuring cleaner reference data.</p>
    </div>


      <div class="problem">
          <h3>Problem 3</h3>
          <p>Searching across multiple diseases sometimes retrieves reference data from unrelated medical documents.</p>
          <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> Each extracted medical document is tagged with its source and associated disease name, stored as a structured JSON file. The system ensures that GPT responses only retrieve information matching the specific disease name.</p>
