          <h2>The Problems with Existing Beer Recommendation Systems</h2>

          <div class="problem">
              <h3>Problem 1</h3>
              <p>Current recommendation systems often lack personalized clustering, which means users receive generic suggestions that donâ€™t match their taste preferences.</p>
              <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> If we implement a clustering-based recommendation system, users will receive more accurate suggestions, improving user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="problem">
              <h3>Problem 2</h3>
              <p>Users cannot easily explore similar beers based on flavor profiles, making it difficult for them to find new beers they might enjoy.</p>
              <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> By clustering beers based on flavor and user preference data, we can create a more intuitive browsing experience that encourages users to try new beers.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="problem">
              <h3>Problem 3</h3>
              <p>The system needs to handle a wide variety of beer types and attributes to ensure it can recommend beers across different categories effectively.</p>
              <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> By designing our system to support multiple beer attributes, we can accommodate a larger variety of beer types, leading to a more versatile and comprehensive recommendation engine.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection & Preprocessing</h2>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            We collected data from two large beer community websites, including information such as beer style, brewery, country, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), and user reviews. The data was scraped and stored in a structured format for analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>
            The raw data was cleaned by converting ABV values to numerical format, removing missing values, and parsing reviews into separate features like aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel, overall rating, and user rating.
        </p>

        <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            To prepare the data for machine learning, categorical features such as beer style and country were encoded, and numerical features were standardized. This helped improve the accuracy of clustering and recommendations.
