        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Machuilin is a machine learning-based beer recommendation system that helps users discover and learn about various beers. The system analyzes user-uploaded photos to detect beer labels, using Microsoft Azureâ€™s Custom Vision to identify the beer and provide relevant details. Additionally, Machuilin uses clustering algorithms to group similar beers, enabling users to explore different types with shared characteristics.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> By offering accurate beer identification, detailed information, and clustering-based recommendations, Machuilin encourages users to broaden their knowledge of beer varieties and enhances their overall experience.</p>

        <h2>Problems Solving</h2> 

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 1</h3>
            <p>Searching for beers with long or unfamiliar names is inconvenient, especially for users who are not beer enthusiasts.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> To enhance the convenience of beer searches, we developed an image-based search system using Azure Custom Vision. Users can take a photo to identify beers instantly. To improve accuracy, the training data includes images taken from various angles, lighting conditions, and perspectives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 2</h3>
            <p>Basic clustering methods can group dissimilar beers, like pilsners and strongly peach-flavored beers, into the same cluster, resulting in poor recommendations.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> We improved clustering results by analyzing beer review data to identify key attributes that users consider important. These attributes were given higher weights during clustering. This approach ensures that beers are grouped more accurately based on user preferences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>Ensuring the reliability of data and selecting reasonable columns for analysis were significant challenges.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> To improve data reliability, we aggregated information from two globally renowned beer community platforms. We utilized review data from users whose nationality was disclosed and who had written at least 10 reviews. This approach ensured high-quality and trustworthy data for the system.</p>

        <h2>Architecture & Data Collection</h2>
        <img src="./assets/machuilin/machuilin_db.png" style="width: 80%;">
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            We gathered data from two major beer community websites, including details such as beer style, brewery, country, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), and user reviews. The collected data was cleaned and structured for analysis by converting ABV values to numerical format, removing missing values, and parsing reviews into distinct features like aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel, overall rating, and user rating.
        </p>

        <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            To prepare the data for machine learning, categorical features such as beer style and country were encoded, and numerical features were standardized. This helped improve the accuracy of clustering and recommendations.

        <h2>Clustering Process and Results</h2><br>
        <h3>Clustering Process</h3>
        <p>
            To provide accurate beer recommendations, we utilized K-means clustering. The data was preprocessed by selecting important features, such as bitterness, sweetness, and ABV (Alcohol By Volume). PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied to reduce dimensions, ensuring faster and more efficient clustering. Weighting was added to attributes identified as significant from user reviews to improve cluster accuracy.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            Our system recommends the three most similar beers within the same cluster for any given input. Additionally, the recommendations include not only the beer types but also detailed information such as the country of origin and taste-related attributes.
