        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Machuilin is a machine learning-based beer recommendation system that helps users discover and learn about various beers. The system analyzes user-uploaded photos to detect beer labels, using Microsoft Azureâ€™s Custom Vision to identify the beer and provide relevant details. Additionally, Machuilin uses clustering algorithms to group similar beers, enabling users to explore different types with shared characteristics.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> By offering accurate beer identification, detailed information, and clustering-based recommendations, Machuilin encourages users to broaden their knowledge of beer varieties and enhances their overall experience.</p>

        <h2>The Problems with Existing Beer Recommendation Systems</h2>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 1</h3>
            <p>Current systems lack personalized, image-based recommendations, making it difficult for users to quickly identify and receive information on specific beers.</p>
            <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> Implementing an image-based recommendation system can provide users with quick, accurate beer information and tailored suggestions, improving convenience and user experience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 2</h3>
            <p>Existing platforms miss opportunities to leverage user data for targeted marketing, limiting the ability to tailor promotions based on consumer preferences and trends.</p>
            <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> By analyzing user preferences, our system can enable data-driven marketing strategies, helping breweries and retailers reach a more relevant audience effectively.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>There are limited revenue generation models that utilize image search and recommendation systems, especially for both online and offline platforms.</p>
            <p><span class="hypothesis">ðŸ’¡ Hypothesis:</span> By incorporating an image-based search and recommendation system, we can maximize revenue in online platforms and create diverse revenue models for offline locations, such as kiosks in retail stores.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection & Preprocessing</h2>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            We collected data from two large beer community websites, including information such as beer style, brewery, country, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), and user reviews. The data was scraped and stored in a structured format for analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>
            The raw data was cleaned by converting ABV values to numerical format, removing missing values, and parsing reviews into separate features like aroma, appearance, flavor, mouthfeel, overall rating, and user rating.
        </p>

        <h3>Feature Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            To prepare the data for machine learning, categorical features such as beer style and country were encoded, and numerical features were standardized. This helped improve the accuracy of clustering and recommendations.
