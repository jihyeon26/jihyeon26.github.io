        <h2>Market Research</h2>
        <p>
          The rise of "Work Smart" principles highlights the growing demand for spaces that balance productivity and employee well-being. Open-plan offices are increasingly popular, yet they present challenges such as noise and privacy concerns. Trends show a shift towards modular and flexible office designs that allow customization based on specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research sources included global office trends and user behavior studies to identify the requirements for an ideal workspace design.

        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          To design a solution that addresses the challenges of modern office environments, I conducted in-depth 
          interviews with employees and managers. The goal was to uncover specific needs 
          and pain points related to workspace design.
        </p>
        <div class="interview">
          <h3>Insights from Employees</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>"I donâ€™t want my monitor to be visible to everyone passing by."</li>
            <li>"Completely enclosed spaces feel suffocating, but I need some visual barriers to focus."</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="interview">
          <h3>Insights from Managers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>"Collaboration is key, but open offices can get too noisy."</li>
            <li>"We need employees to be able to interact with each other.."</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
