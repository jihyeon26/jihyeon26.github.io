        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Medly is a platform designed to support both physicians and patients throughout the pre-surgery process. It provides structured assistance by recording and summarizing consent forms for patients while helping them understand medical terminology. For physicians, it offers a chatbot that enables efficient searching of essential pre-surgery information, including medical research papers and various surgical guidelines.
            <br>
            The project <strong>won second place in the Microsoft AI School's</strong> third round of projects.

      <h2>Problems Solving</h2> 

      <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
        <p>Processing data from multiple sources with different PDF formats (ranging from 50 to 280 pages) and refining it for chatbot integration. Understanding and organizing all the content manually is impractical, necessitating a structured format that computers can interpret.</p>
        <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> Text was extracted from PDFs and vectorized through embedding, enabling the system to process language autonomously. Additionally, chunk sizes were optimized (1000 characters with 100-character overlap) to maintain context while ensuring the summarization was not overly condensed, improving chatbot performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
        <h3>Problem 2</h3>
        <p>Ensuring the reliability of medical chatbot responses while preventing hallucinations, and optimizing reference section readability for busy physicians.</p>
        <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> The system provides reference areas with original data sources, enabling physicians to verify AI responses. The RAG model uses high strictness and a low temperature setting to prevent hallucinations. Chunking methods optimize reference text length, and preprocessing removes redundant headers and irrelevant characters for clarity.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="problem">
          <h3>Problem 3</h3>
          <p>Searching across multiple diseases sometimes retrieves reference data from unrelated medical documents.</p>
          <p><span class="solution">ðŸ’¡ Solution:</span> Each extracted medical document is tagged with its source and associated disease name, stored as a structured JSON file. The system ensures that GPT responses only retrieve information matching the specific disease name.</p>

                <h3>1. Evaluation Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Process Overview:</strong>
                    <br>               
                <img src="./assets/medly/eval.png" alt="ui" style="width:100%;">
                

                <p>
                    <strong>Reason for Not Using Existing Benchmark Datasets and Traditional Metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.)</strong><br>
                    - <strong>Benchmark datasets like PubMed QA and MedQA</strong> are based on general knowledge, while RAG models rely on retrieving specific external data. Evaluating with such datasets is ineffective since RAG should be evaluated on how well it retrieves and utilizes provided information.<br>
                    - <strong>Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE</strong> focus on text similarity, which does not fully capture the accuracy of RAG-generated responses. Instead, evaluation should measure context retrieval quality, response faithfulness, and alignment with the intended answer.<br>
                    * All model configurations for evaluation were implemented manually to align with the specific requirements of my model.

                <p>
                    <strong>Key Metrics:</strong>
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Answer Accuracy</strong>: Measures correctness of generated responses.
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Faithfulness</strong>:  Measures how factually consistent a response is with the retrieved context based on the RAGAS metric.
                    <br>
                    - <strong>Recall@5</strong>: Determines if the correct context is among the top 5 retrieved documents.

                <p>
                    <strong>Evaluation of Accuracy:</strong><br>                                
                    - The RAG model demonstrated significantly superior performance over the base model in terms of answer accuracy.
                    <br>
                    - The best overall performance was observed when using 1000-character chunks with text-embedding-ada-002.
                    <br>
                    - Since the accuracy of answered responses is more critical, the average score of answered responses was prioritized as a key metric, excluding unanswered responses.
                    <br>
                    - The number of responses that received a perfect score (5/5) and those scoring below 3 were analyzed to evaluate the generation of high-quality answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Evaluation of Retrieval:</strong><br>
                    - The performance of different embedding models and chunk sizes was evaluated based on retrieval accuracy.
                    <br>
                    - Recall@5 was used to measure how often the correct context appeared in the top 5 retrieved results.
                    <br>
                    - The combination of 1000-character chunks and text embedding-ADA-002 had the highest faithfulness and also scored well on Recall@5. 
                </p>
                
                
                <p><strong>Final Decision:</strong> Based on the evaluation, the combination of 1000-character chunks and text-embedding-ada-002 was selected for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Reliable Data Sources:</strong> Surgical guideline PDFs were collected from authoritative sources such as NCCN, NCI, and PubMed Central (PMC), covering a total of 64 diseases.    
                <br>       
                <strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Only text within the main content area was extracted, excluding headers and footers. Unnecessary text and repeated characters were removed, and any remaining noise was eliminated using regular expressions.
                <br>
                <strong>Chunk Generation:</strong> To enhance search performance and maintain context, text was divided into chunks of 1,000 characters with a 100-character overlap.
                <br>
                <strong>JSON File Storage:</strong> Data was stored in JSON format, including disease names, chunk IDs, and data sources to ensure reliability.
