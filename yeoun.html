    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
    Yeo-un is an interactive product designed to address the growing social issue of loneliness among single-person households in their 20s, a problem that can escalate to severe mental health challenges, including depression and, in extreme cases, suicidal ideation. Based on surveys and interviews, the project focuses on reducing loneliness by recreating the warmth and comfort of meaningful conversations and human connection.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yeo-un offers an interactive experience that allows users to feel a sense of warmth and connection, even when returning to an empty, dark home. It is part of a comprehensive brand initiative that includes not just the product, but also related items like clothing and organizers, all designed to foster emotional well-being and community.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Impact:</strong> By combining interactive design with emotional engagement, Yeo-un helps reduce feelings of isolation, supports mental health, and creates an inviting atmosphere that fosters a sense of connection and warmth.
    </p>
