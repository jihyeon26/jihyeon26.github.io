        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 1</h3>
            <p>Labor law information is often inaccessible or difficult to interpret for non-experts.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">💡 Solution:</span> Labor LawBot utilizes a conversational AI model enhanced with indexed labor law precedents, providing simplified and case-specific insights to users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 2</h3>
            <p>Generative AI models occasionally produce hallucinated information, which can be problematic in a precedent-based service.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">💡 Solution:</span> To mitigate hallucinations, the model’s response content was strictly limited to the indexed dataset by maximizing data resource strictness and setting a low temperature to reduce creative responses. Additionally, cited data references were included in answers, enabling users to directly verify the source of information.
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>Providing up-to-date, accurate, and trustworthy legal information is a challenge.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">💡 Solution:</span> A curated dataset of 1,089 labor law precedents ensures reliable insights. The system directs users to trusted legal databases like LawInfo for further detailed searches.</p>
