        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 1</h3>
            <p>Labor law information is often inaccessible or difficult to interpret for non-experts.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">💡 Solution:</span> Labor LawBot utilizes a conversational AI model enhanced with indexed labor law precedents, providing simplified and case-specific insights to users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 2</h3>
            <p>Generative AI models occasionally produce hallucinated information, which can be problematic in a precedent-based service.</p>
            <p><span class="solution">💡 Solution:</span> To mitigate hallucinations, the model’s response content was strictly limited to the indexed dataset by maximizing data resource strictness and setting a low temperature to reduce creative responses. Additionally, cited data references were included in answers, enabling users to directly verify the source of information.

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>Providing up-to-date, accurate, and trustworthy legal information is a challenge.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question: </strong>If I've worked for more than one year but less than two years, how many vacation days am I entitled to?</p>
                    <p><strong>Answer: </strong> you have worked for a period of more than one year but less than two years, the number of annual leave days (annual paid vacation) is as follows.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you've worked 80% or more of the year, you're entitled to 15 days of annual leave.
                        If you have worked for less than a year, your annual leave is calculated proportionally to the number of days you have worked.
                        So, if you've worked for more than one year but less than two years, you'll be granted 15 days of annual leave, and you may accrue additional days based on your attendance rate during this time [doc1].
                        
                        Furthermore, the use of annual leave is regulated by the Labor Standards Act, and unused annual leave may be carried forward .
